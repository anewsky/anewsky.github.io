        <div id="About" class="about">
            A New Sky Coaching is professional communication coaching from Anya Newsky.

            Anya Newsky helps people who are frustrated with small mix ups causing big problems in their relationships, who want
            to figure out what’s not working so they know what needs to change and how to change it, without nagging.

            She specializes in non-traditional relationships as those communities are underserved and her background
            growing up in a community of non-traditional love and lifestyles makes her well equipped to help.

            Additionally, she was raised by parents studying and implementing ontological design principles and
            communication like nonviolent communication, including one of the father’s of ontological design, Fernando
            Flores.

            At age 13, she was made an Honorary Intern at the Human Awareness Institute, focused on love, intimacy and
            sexuality, by their founder, Stan Dale. Through the course work and her intern work, Anya learned how to
            communicate emotions and feelings in a way that can be received.

            Anya’s expertise is in supporting people to break the cycle of misunderstandings and know how to ask really
            great questions, so they stop getting sucked into old patterns.

            She has completed multiple courses of study with HAI, Insight Seminars, and PAX Programs, and is a certified
            practitioner of the Anat Baniel Method of NeuroMovement practicing for over 7 years.
